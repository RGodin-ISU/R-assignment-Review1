# README
a description of the files within the folder
* `R-assignment.Rmd` and `R-assignment.HTML`: my codes and comments for the assignment
*  sorted files can be found in sorted_mazie_files and teosinte_sorted_files. sortv1 cotains data sorted with increasing position values and sortv2 contains data sorted with decreasing position values.
* `maize.txt` and `teosinte.txt`: cropped maize and teosinte genotype data from the file fang_et_al_genotypes
* `maize_joined.txt` and `teosinte_joined.txt`: contain SNP_ID, chromosome, SNP positions, followed by cropped maize and teosinte genotype data from the file fang_et_al_genotypes
* `transposed_genotypes" is the transpose of `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt`
* `SNP_position_mod` contains the `SNP_position` data with two blank lines inserted at the top to have the same number of rows for producing `maize_joined` and `teosinte_joined` later. 
* The two files `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` and `snp_positions.txt` are data files you will be reformatting for the assignment
